# AI Systems Analyst – Project Report (Deep Thought)

This repository contains my **AI Systems Analyst** project.  
The project demonstrates my ability in **call analysis, structured communication, company profiling, and proposing scraper logic** using publicly available sources.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is divided into two major tasks:

### ✅ Task 1: Call Analysis
Focused on analyzing a founder conversation using:
- Clear and warm communication
- Strong attention to detail
- Identifying user intent
- Asking relevant follow-up questions
- Avoiding jargon and judgmental tone
- Building trust and collaboration

### ✅ Task 2: Company Profiling + Scraper Logic
Focused on researching a founder-led company and proposing a scraper system to extract ICP signals.

## 🏢 Company Selected (Real-World Practical)
**Zoho** – Founder-led global SaaS company.

Zoho was selected to demonstrate:
- ICP evaluation
- Website-based evidence extraction
- Company fit scoring and classification
- Scraper logic proposal

## 🧩 Framework Used

### Step 1: Understand ICP
Reviewed publicly available pages:
- About Us / Our Story
- Services & Products
- Blog / Newsletter
- Careers
- Community / Culture pages

### Step 2: Evaluate Company Fitness
Signals evaluated:
- Vision & Future Orientation

### Step 3: Score Each Category
Each signal scored using evidence found on the website.

### Step 4: Final Classification
Final classification based on total score:
- **0 → Not Fit**
- **1–2 → Partially Fit**
- **3–8 → Fit**
